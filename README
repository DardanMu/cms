This is a custom CMS written in PHP and uses a MySQL database.

There are two parts to this cms, a public area of the site and a private admin only area, to edit, delete, and insert posts. 

The markup and design is separate from the PHP and it is really easy to implement on an existing site. 

There is still more work to be done to this, and I will be updating it accordingly. 

TODO:
-Pagination
-Edit the PHP to be more Object-Oriented
-Change the css and html designs
-Create 'comment' section



Feel free to look at the code and message me for any details.
