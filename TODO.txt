TODO:

- create the Edit area.
- php Pagination
- title link goes to that post only (or "read more..." link)
- redesign the site, make it look nice
-TEST Jgardening site with this cms to see if it can be exported to other sites using their own html css etc. Make a new page called newsfeed there with the same template format the Jgardening site has, and print_contents() in the html to display posts from a database.
